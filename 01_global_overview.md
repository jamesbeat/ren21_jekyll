Renewable energy continued to grow in 2014 against the backdrop of increasing global energy consumption and a dramatic decline in oil prices during the second half of the year.[^1] Global final energy consumption has increased by about 1.5% annually in recent years, driven primarily by rising demand in developing countries.[^2]
Despite rising energy use, for the first time in four decades, global carbon emissions associated with energy consumption remained stable in 2014 while the global economy grew.[^3] Whereas previous emissions decreases were associated with downturns in the global economy, the carbon stabilisation in 2014 has been attributed to increased penetration of renewable energy and improvements in energy efficiency.[^4] Looking ahead, several countries—including China, Mexico, and the United States—as well as the European Union have announced climate change commitments that set the stage for future investment in renewables and energy efficiency.[^5]

There is rising awareness worldwide that renewable energy and energy efficiency are critical not only for addressing climate change, but also for creating new economic opportunities, and for providing energy access to the billions of people still living without modern energy services.i Renewables are vital elements of rural electrification programmes in many countries, and dozens of international actors were involved in advancing energy access through renewables during 2014.[^6]

In recognition of the importance of renewable energy and energy efficiency for sustainable development, the United Nations General Assembly declared 2014 the first year of a Decade of Sustainable Energy for Allii (SE4ALL).[^7] SE4ALL aims to double the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix from a baseline share of 18% in 2010 to 36% in 2030.[^8]

By 2013, the most recent year for which data are available, renewable energy provided an estimated 19.1% of global final energy consumption. Of this total share, traditional biomass, used primarily for cooking and heating in remote and rural areas of developing countries, accounted for about 9%, and modern renewables increased their share slightly over 2012 to approximately 10.1%.[^9] (pSee Figure 1.) 
Modern renewable energy is being used increasingly in four distinct markets: power generation, heating and cooling, transport, and rural/off-grid energy services. (pSee Distributed Renewable Energy section.) In 2013, hydropower accounted for an estimated 3.9% of final energy consumption; other renewable power sources comprised 1.3%; renewable heat energy accounted for approximately 4.1%; and transport biofuels provided about 0.8%.[^10]

In 2014, renewable energy overall expanded significantly in terms of capacity installed and energy produced. Some technologies experienced more rapid growth in deployment in 2014 than they have averaged over the past five years.[^11] (pSee Figure 2.) In the heating sector, capacity installations continued at a steady pace; the production of biofuels for transport increased for the second consecutive year, following a slowdown in 2011-2012. The most rapid growth, and the largest increase in capacity, occurred in the power sector. 

Although many renewable energy technologies have experienced rapid expansion, growth in capacity and improvements in energy efficiency are below the rates necessary to achieve the SE4ALL goal.[^12] Further, the bulk of new capacity and investment has centred on just three technologies: solar PV, wind, and hydropower.

Renewable energy developments in 2014 continued to be driven largely by government policy.[^13] (pSee Policy Landscape section.) Renewables faced challenges in some countries resulting from policy changes or uncertainties, such as the imposition of new taxes in Europe and the expiration of the US federal production tax credit. At the same time, the number of countries with renewable energy targets and policies increased again in 2014, and several jurisdictions made their existing targets more ambitious. Policymakers have focused predominantly on the power sector, with the least attention paid to heating and cooling and to transport beyond biofuels, a trend that has helped to shape the current landscape.

By early 2015, several jurisdictions had 100% renewable energy or electricity targets in place. The vast majority of such targets exist at the city/local level, with a growing number of state and provincial governments pursuing 100% goals.[^14] Increasingly, 100% renewable energy and electricity goals also are being explored and deployed at the national level—for example, in countries such as Cabo Verde, Costa Rica, and Denmark.[^15]

Growth also is driven by the increasing cost-competiveness of renewable energy. Renewable energy costs continued to decline in 2014, and in many countries renewables are broadly competitive with conventional energy sources.[^16] In terms of cost and environmental performance, distributed renewable systems also are competitive with fossil fuels (especially diesel) for heat and electricity in islands and remote jurisdictions, and, in general, for providing access to modern energy services.[^17] In remote and rural areas of developing countries—and increasingly deployed to power mini- and micro-grids—renewables are playing a large and growing role in providing essential and productive energy services, due largely to growing recognition of their cost-effectiveness.[^18]

At the same time, growth in renewable energy (and energy efficiency improvements) continues to be tempered by subsidies to fossil fuels and nuclear power, particularly in developing countries. Subsidies keep conventional energy prices artificially low, which makes it more difficult for renewable energy to compete. Artificially low prices also discourage energy efficiency and conservation, which increases the amount of energy that renewables must produce in order to meet the SE4ALL goals.[^19] In 2013, global subsidies for fossil fuels exceeded USD 550 billion.[^20] In 2014, close to 30 countries reduced or eliminated their fossil fuel subsidies, with some doing so in response to low oil prices.[^21]

As costs fall, renewable energy markets continue to diversify geographically.[^22] While Europe remained an important regional market and a centre for innovation, activity continued to shift towards other regions. China again led the world in new renewable power capacity installations in 2014, and Brazil, India, and South Africa accounted for a large share of the capacity added in their respective regions.[^23] (pSee Sidebar 1.) At the same time, the number of developing countries across Asia, Africa, and Latin America that were manufacturing and deploying renewable energy technologies continued to expand.[^24]

Global investment in renewable power and fuels rebounded in 2014, with increased investment in all regions of the world. Renewables outpaced fossil fuels for the fifth year running in terms of net investment in power capacity additions, due almost entirely to increased investment in solar and wind power.[^25] (pSee Investment Flows section.) 
By dollars spent, the leading countries for investment were China, the United States, Japan, the United Kingdom, and Germany. However, considering investments made in new renewable power and fuels relative to annual GDP, top countries included Burundi, Kenya, Honduras, Jordan, and Uruguay.i The leading countries for investment per inhabitant were the Netherlands, Japan, Uruguay, the United Kingdom and Ireland and Canada (both about even).[^26]

New investment vehicles for renewables—such as green bonds, yieldcosii, and securitisation—also expanded, as did the number and variety of crowdfunding platforms for renewable energy in developed and developing countries.[^27] (pSee Distributed Renewable Energy section.) These innovations attract new classes of capital providers (e.g., institutional and retail investors) and help to reduce the cost of capital for financing renewable energy projects, which, in turn, further improves the competitiveness of renewable energy. 

In parallel with growth in renewable energy markets, 2014 saw significant advances in the development and deployment of storage systems across all energy sectors. Energy storage (via pumped storage, batteries, thermal storage, and other means) is used primarily to provide peak shifting and frequency regulation services in the power sector, with very small but growing markets for the use of batteries for electric vehicle propulsion in the transportation sector, and for thermal energy storage in the heating and cooling sector.[^28] Although batteries comprise only a small part of global storage capacity, several trends may signal future market ramp-up.[^29] For example, innovative business and deployment models that integrate renewables and on-grid storage expanded in 2014, and massive manufacturing plants for the production of lithium-ion batteries were announced in China and the United States.[^30]

Another trend that continued to emerge in 2014 is the increasing electrification of transportation and heating applications, highlighting the potential for further overlap among the sectors in the future. [^31] The increasing electrification of personal vehicles and heating systems likely will require greater amounts of renewable capacity in order to meet existing power sector targets (e.g., RPS). At the same time, electric transportation and heating can be used to balance variable renewable power generation. Electric heating, for example, is being used for balancing both at the system level (e.g., using electricity from the grid to feed heat into district heating networks) and at the consumer level (e.g., the combination of solar PV and heat pumps). 

## Power Sector
The most significant renewables growth in 2014 occurred in the power sector, with global renewable power capacity reaching an estimated 1,712 GW at year’s end, an increase of 8.5% over 2013.[^32] Hydropower capacity rose by 3.6% to approximately 1,055 GW, while other renewables collectively grew nearly 18% to an estimated total approaching 660 GW.[^33] Globally, wind and solar PV each saw record capacity additions, each surpassing hydropower and together they accounted for more than 90% of non-hydro installations in 2014.[^34] (R**See Reference Table R1.**). 

In 2014, renewables made up an estimated 58.5% of net additions to global power capacity and represented far higher shares of capacity added in several countries around the world.[^35] By year’s end, renewables comprised an estimated 27.7% of the world’s power generating capacity.[^36] This was enough to supply an estimated 22.8% of global electricity, with hydropower providing about 16.6%.[^37] (pSee Figure 3.) Over the period 2007–2012, renewable power generation grew at an average rate of 5.9% per year.[^38] In contrast, global electricity consumption increased by an annual average rate of 2.7% in the same period, with electricity consumption in non-OECD countries growing twice as rapidly.[^39]

Variable renewables are achieving high levels of penetration in several countries. For example, throughout 2014, wind power met 39.1% of electricity demand in Denmark, 27% in Portugal, and 21% in Nicaragua; solar PV capacity in operation at the end of 2014 was enough to meet an estimated 7.9% of electricity demand in Italy, 7.6% in Greece, and 7% in Germany.[^40] 

By the end of 2014, China, the United States, Brazil, Germany, and Canada remained the top countries for total installed renewable electric capacity.[^41] China was home to approximately one-fourth of the world’s renewable power capacity, including about 280 GW of hydropower.[^42] The top countries for non-hydro capacity were China, the United States, and Germany; they were followed by Italy, Spain, Japan, and India, which all ended the year with similar capacity levels.[^43] (pSee Figure 4 and **Reference Table R2.**) Among the world’s top 20 countries for non-hydro renewable power capacity, those with the highest capacity amounts per inhabitant were all in Europe. Denmark had a clear lead and was followed by Germany, Sweden, Spain, and Portugal.iii [^44]

Regionally, **Asia** installed the most generating capacity–led by China, which added the most wind power, solar PV, and hydropower capacity of any country in the world.[^45] There also was significant market growth in Asia more broadly, with Thailand adding more solar PV (0.5 GW) than many European countries, and the Philippines and Pakistan each bringing on line significant amounts of wind power capacity.[^46]
Within the **European Union**, renewables accounted for the majority (78%) of new generating capacity for the seventh year running. Germany increased its share of non-hydropower renewable generation from 10.5% in 2010 to 24% by 2014, whereas Scotland supplied close to half of its electricity from renewables in 2014.[^47]

**North America** experienced significant solar PV and wind market growth, although the vast technical potential for both resources remains largely untapped. In the United States, more renewable energy capacity was built than natural gas capacity, and non-hydropower resources out-produced hydropower for the first time.[^48]

In **Latin America and the Caribbean**, Brazil continued to lead in terms of total new capacity additions. Brazil commissioned over 3 GW of hydropower and a record 2.5 GW of wind power capacity.[^49] Both Chile and Mexico achieved significant increases in wind and solar PV, and Uruguay added the most wind capacity per capita globally.[^50]

**Africa** also saw a surge in new renewable energy installations. South Africa was among the top 10 solar PV markets for the first time (ranked 9th), ahead of India, and led the continent in new wind installations.[^51] Kenya installed more than half of the world’s new geothermal capacity, and Rwanda significantly increased its total generating capacity with the addition of new hydropower capacity (at least 30 MW) and an 8.5 MW solar PV plant.[^52]

The rapid growth of renewable energy generation created both challenges and opportunities in 2014. In countries where energy consumption is expanding, both renewable energy and fossil fuel generation are developing in parallel to meet growing demand. In countries with slow or negative growth in electricity consumption (e.g., several OECD countries), renewable energy increasingly is displacing existing generation.[^53] In response to this competition, some utilities and electricity suppliers in Europe and North America are repositioning by acquiring significant renewable energy assets, decreasing fossil fuel investments, and acquiring other utilities that already have significant amounts of renewable energy in their generation portfolios.[^54]

At the same time, policymakers in some jurisdictions are requiring utilities to update their business models and grid infrastructure to support increased shares of renewable energy.[^55] In addition, several countries and regions continued to strengthen their transmission systems in 2014, to increase capacity for higher penetrations of variable renewables, and to build transmission lines specifically to access strong renewable resources, for example in India and Africa.[^56] Countries around the world also are exploring other new and innovative approaches to accommodating rising shares of renewable energy.[^57] (pSee Sidebar 2.)

Globally, renewable electricity production in 2014 continued to be dominated by large (e.g., megawatt-scale) generators that are owned by utilities or large investors. Yet Australia, Europe, Japan, and North America also have seen significant growth in numbers of residential “prosumers”–electricity customers who produce their own power.[^58] France held national dialogues on how to best support (and manage) prosumers, and the European Union began exploring guidance for member nations on self-consumption regulations.[^59] In developed and developing countries, industrial prosumers also produced significant amounts of renewable generation from waste biomass associated with agriculture and forestry.[^60]

Community and co-operative ownership of grid-connected renewables also expanded during 2014, particularly for solar PV. Feed-in tariffs supporting community-owned renewables continued to operate in jurisdictions such as Thailand and Nova Scotia.[^61] Also, the first community-owned ocean energy system was installed in Scotland.[^62] Both Denmark and Germany have a long tradition of community and local ownership of renewable energy systems.[^63] In Germany, 47% of the renewable energy generation was owned by individuals or investor co-operatives as of 2012, although that percentage has declined in recent years.[^64] 

Major corporations and institutions around the world made substantial commitments in 2014 to purchase renewable energy, and a group of corporations committed to achieve 100% renewable energy under the RE100 Initiative.[^65] Large companies also independently announced expenditures of several billion dollars to own (or purchase electricity from) renewable energy generators.[^66] The mining industry is investing in renewable energy systems to improve reliability and reduce energy costs, with renewable energy systems to generate power and heat installed or under development at mines in Brazil, Canada, Chile, South Africa, and Tanzania.[^67]

Voluntary purchases of renewable energy from traditional utilities continued to increase, primarily in the power sector. Germany remains one of the world’s green power leaders, and other European countries have active green power markets as well.[^68] Germany’s market grew from 0.8 million residential customers in 2006 to 5.7 million in 2013, with 14.3% of all private households in the country purchasing a combined total of 19.5 TWh of renewable electricity. When commercial customers are included, green power purchases in Germany exceeded 29.6 TWh.[^69]

Green power markets also exist in Australia, Canada, Japan, South Africa, and the United States. More than half of US electricity customers have the option to purchase green power directly from their local utility or electricity supplier. In 2013, US retail green power sales totalled 62 TWh (about 1.7% of total US electricity sales), purchased by approximately 5.4 million customers.[^70]

## Heating and Cooling Sector
Energy use for heat accounted for about half of total world final energy consumption in 2014.[^71] Renewable energy supplied more than 25% of final energy use in the heating sector, of which over two-thirds was traditional biomass.[^72] Modern renewable energy supplied the remaining third—or approximately 8% of total heat. Therefore, modern renewable heating accounts for a significant share of renewable energy’s total contribution to final energy use. Even so, there exists vast additional potential for the expansion of renewable heat, and for low-temperature heating applications in particular.[^73]

In 2014, bioenergy accounted for over 90% of the modern renewable energy portion, with solar thermal and geothermal supplying the remainder.[^74] About half of modern renewable heat is consumed by industry, where it meets an estimated 10% of total heat demand and is produced almost entirely from biomass.[^75] Growth has been relatively slow in the industry sector in recent years.[^76] 
The other half of renewable heat consumption occurs in buildings for space heating, water heating, and cooking, and is derived primarily from biomass, with solar and geothermal contributing much smaller shares. Most growth of renewable energy use for heat in the buildings sector has been driven by support policies, although there are increasing numbers of locations and circumstances in which renewable heat technologies are cost-competitive with fossil fuels.[^77]

Renewable energy also is used for cooling, and there is growing interest in regions around the world, including Asia, Europe, the Middle East, and North America, where it offers the potential to reduce electricity loads.[^78] In recent years, the global solar cooling market has grown at an annual rate exceeding 40%.[^79] However, the number of installations worldwide remains limited.[^80]
Global demand for heat energy grew at an average annual rate of 2.6% between 2008 and 2012, driven primarily by increased demand for heat in industry and buildings in developing countries.[^81] Cooling demand also has increased dramatically—up 60% during the decade from 2000 to 2010—as a result of improved energy access and rising global temperatures.[^82]

In recent years, global growth in the use of traditional biomass for heating has begun to level off due to increasing urbanisation and access to modern energy sources in developing countries.[^83] By contrast, global consumption of modern renewable energy in the heating sector increased by an average of 2.4% annually from 2007 to 2013.[^84] Despite this increase, the total share of modern renewable energy in the heating sector has remained steady because of continuing growth in final energy use for heat.[^85]

Renewable energy for heating is fairly evenly distributed around the world as a result of the use of industrial biomass in many countries. However, there are important differences in renewable heating trends at the regional level: 
**Asia** uses the largest amount of modern renewable energy in the heating sector overall, driven primarily by the amount of industrial bio-heat used in India and other Asian countries.[^86] China continued to dominate the global solar heating market in 2014 and to lead the world in the direct use of geothermal, and in biogas for heat.[^87]
**Europe** leads the world in modern renewable energy as a share of heating energy (14.7% in 2013), and European countries such as Iceland, Norway, and Sweden have some of the highest renewable heating penetrations in the world (over 50%).[^88] Europe also leads in innovations such as solar thermal combi-systems, the integration of solar heat into district energy networks as well as industrial processes, and the development of smaller-scale geothermal CHP and heating plants.[^89]
The **United States** continued to be a leader in solar water collector capacity during 2014, although this market has slowed in recent years.[^90] Overall, total renewable energy for heating in North America declined from 2007 to 2013 due to decreases in biomass consumption in the industrial sector.[^91]
In **Latin America**, expansion of renewable thermal energy use in recent years has been driven primarily by biomass growth.[^92] At the same time, Brazil has experienced strong growth in solar water heating, and Mexico also is becoming a notable market; several other countries in the region have experienced growth in solar water heating even without public incentives.[^93]
In **Africa**, modern renewable thermal energy plays a modest but important role, particularly in countries such as Mauritius, Ethiopia, and Kenya that have sugarcane industries fuelling co-generation plants with bagasse.[^94] South Africa’s solar water heating market led the continent, although markets across Africa continued to add solar heating capacity in 2014.[^95]
In the** Middle East**, solar hot water is an important resource in many countries. Israel leads for total capacity of solar water collectors, followed by the Palestinian Territories, Jordan, and Lebanon.[^96] About 85% of Israeli households use solar water heaters.[^97] Interest in solar cooling is also rising in the region.[^98] 

The year 2014 witnessed the continuation of several trends that are increasing renewable energy’s potential to play a larger role in the heating and cooling sector. These included: energy efficiency improvements in industrial processes, in heating and cooling systems, and in building materials; rising interest in net zero energy buildings (NZE); and a growing number of countries with NZE mandates for 2020 and beyond. (pSee Energy Efficiency section and Sidebar 7.) 

The expansion of district energy systems also may provide increased opportunities for renewable heating and cooling. District energy supplies approximately 12% of residential and commercial heating in Europe, and some countries in Europe and elsewhere have much higher percentages.[^99] China, for example, doubled its district heating networks between 2005 and 2011 and supplies an estimated 30% of its heating demand from district systems.[^100] Worldwide, an estimated 6% of modern renewable heat in buildings is provided through such networks.[^101] A number of developed countries, especially in Europe, are integrating solar, biomass, and geothermal heat into district systems.[^102] Denmark more than doubled the total solar thermal capacity in its district heating networks between 2012 and the end of 2014.[^103]

A small number of countries, such as Denmark and Ireland, also has begun using district heat systems and other technologies to absorb heat generated by renewable electricity during periods of excess supply (e.g., through the use of heat pumps or resistance heaters).[^104] China called on high-wind provinces to begin pilot testing of wind-to-heat technologies to ease the strain on local grids and reduce local air pollution.[^105]

Another significant trend is a move towards the use of hybrid systems that integrate several energy resources (such as solar thermal or biomass with heat pumps) to serve different heat applications.[^106] China’s market for hybrid-heat pump products is double the size of Europe’s, and both markets are expanding rapidly.[^107] There is also growing interest in the use of larger-scale heat pumps for district heating as well as industrial processes.[^108]

Despite these innovations in renewable heating, a limited awareness of the technologies, the distributed nature of consumption and fragmentation of the heating market, and a relative lack of policy support has constrained growth in the sector. Further, the sector has faced headwinds due to low fossil fuel prices, ongoing fossil fuel subsidies (especially for natural gas), as well as competition from other possible investments, such as energy efficiency improvements or other renewable energy systems (e.g., solar PV, heat pumps, and solar PV / heat pump hybrids).[^109] Solar thermal has experienced the fastest growth among the modern renewable energy sources, but the pace of growth continued to slow in 2014 in response to such challenges.

## Transport Sector
There are three main entry points for renewable energy in the transport sector: the use of 100% liquid biofuels or blended biofuels with conventional fuels; the growing role of natural gas; and the increasing electrification of transportation. Trends in each of these areas have contributed to the evolving landscape for renewable energy in the transport sector. To date, however, the primary focus of policies, markets, and industries in the transport sector has been on liquid biofuels.[^110]

Demand for oil in transportation has increased significantly as a result of growth in private motorisation, primarily in developing countries. However, increased fuel economy in cars and other light-duty vehicles, as well as improved transportation strategies, have helped temper demand.[^111] During the period 2008–2012, global demand for motor gasoline increased by 1.2% annually, with growth skewed towards non-OECD countries, at 5.1% annually.[^112] 

The share of renewables in transportation remains small. Renewable energy accounted for an estimated 3.5% of global energy demand for road transport in 2013, up from 2% in 2007.[^113] (At the same time, transport fuels accounted for the second largest share of renewable energy jobs globally. pSee Sidebar 3.) Liquid biofuels—primarily ethanol and biodiesel—represent the vast majority of the renewable share. Biofuels’ contribution to the transport sector is considerably higher in some European countries, in the United States, and in Brazil—where the share of biofuels in road transport fuel exceeded 20% in 2014.[^114] Liquid biofuels are used mainly for passenger vehicles and heavy-duty road vehicle applications. 

Beyond liquid biofuels, relatively small but increasing quantities of gaseous biofuels, including biomethane (purified biogas), are being used to fuel vehicles. Renewables also are used in the form of electricity for trains, light rail, trams, and both two- and four-wheeled electric vehicles. 

Although concerns about the environmental, economic, and social sustainability of biofuels constrained growth in some regions, almost all major producing nations increased their production of biofuels in 2014 relative to 2013.[^115]

The **United States** continued to lead the world in both biodiesel and ethanol production; ethanol output expanded from 2013 to 2014, despite policy uncertainties.[^116] **Canada** also saw marginal increases in biofuels production in 2014 and was one of the world’s top five producers of fuel ethanol.[^117]
Brazil’s production of ethanol and biodiesel expanded in 2014, and output of smaller producers in** Latin America**, such as Argentina and Colombia, also increased. Argentina’s output was up 28% in response to national incentives and a blend mandate, and it ranked fifth globally for production of biofuels in 2014.[^118]
The **European Union** considered capping the contribution of biofuels derived from sugars, starch, and oil crops due to sustainability concerns.[^119] At the same time, EU countries struggled to meet their renewable energy targets for transportation.[^120] Against this background, the amount of biofuel production increased during 2014, with Germany leading the region.[^121]
Biofuels production expanded rapidly in **Asia** during 2013–2014, where the region’s top three producers (China, Indonesia, and Thailand) collectively increased their production by 16%.[^122]
Production levels in **Africa** remained small in 2014, although several sub-Saharan countries have national biofuel (mostly ethanol) blending mandates in place.[^123]
There continue to be advances in new markets and in new applications for biofuels. In 2014, commercial flights in Norway and Sweden were fuelled by aviation biofuel, and airlines in Brazil, China, Indonesia, South Africa, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), the United Kingdom, and the United States announced aviation biofuel supply agreements or plans to integrate aviation biofuel into future flights.[^124]

Around the world, militaries—including the navies of Australia, Chile, Italy, and the United States—continued to pursue biofuels development in 2014.[^125] The US military announced the first successful supersonic flight fuelled by renewable isobutanol in December 2014.[^126]

Beyond liquid biofuels, trends in the development of gaseous fuels and electricity continued to create pathways for the integration of renewables into transportation. The number of compressed natural gas vehicles and fuelling stations continued to expand in 2014, creating parallel opportunities for gaseous biofuels such as biomethane.[^127] Limited but growing quantities of biomethane are fuelling cars, buses, and other vehicles in several EU countries (most notably Germany, Finland, and Sweden).[^128] Although biomethane production is concentrated primarily in Europe, plans are under way in other regions—including Brazil, as well as countries in Asia and North America—to develop facilities for production and vehicle fuelling.[^129]

The electrification of the transport sector expanded further during the year. The number of electric passenger vehicles on the road nearly doubled from 350,000 in 2013 to 665,000 in 2014.[^130] The United States led the world in the size of its electric vehicle (EV) passenger fleet, but Norway led in the share of EVs in annual vehicle sales in 2014 (12%+).[^131] As of early 2015, China was home to 97% of the world’s 235 million electric two wheelers and 79% of the world’s 46,000 electric buses.[^132] In 2014, there also was continuous growth in electric public transport, including the expansion of electric passenger rail, light rail, and trolley systems.[^133] In 2014, Bhutan announced that it would use its ample renewable resources to electrify its transportation sector, starting with government fleets and taxis.[^134]

These trends enable greater integration of renewable energy into the transport sector, but only to the extent that the associated electricity demand is met with new renewables, as electric vehicles are only as "renewable" as their power source.[^135] EVs can be connected directly to renewable energy charging stations, and also can have renewable energy integrated directly into their designs, but such direct links remain rare.[^136] EV storage can also be utilised to balance variable renewable electricity, although this function remains at the demonstration stage.[^137] 
In Europe, a combination of on-site renewable energy and voluntary green power purchase programmes has enabled some rail systems to declare that their trains are, or soon will be, powered with renewable electricity and fuels. The Swedish passenger train company (SJ) has powered its trains with 100% renewable energy for a number of years, the Swiss Federal Railway (SBB) has a goal to move from 75% renewable energy to 100% by 2025, and Deutsche Bahn in Germany previously committed to achieve 100% renewable energy by 2050.[^138] In 2014, the national rail system of the Netherlands established a goal to move to 50% renewable energy in 2015 and 100% by 2018, while the German region of Rhein-Hunsrück redirects its excess renewable energy generation to its transit system.[^139] Beyond Europe, Indian Railways committed in 2014 to using up to 5% biofuels for its trains.[^140]
